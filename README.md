# Surfs Up

## Overview

W. Avy wants more information about temperature trends before opening the surf shop. Specifically, he wants temperature data for the months of June and December in Oahu, in order to determine if the surf and ice cream shop business is sustainable year-round. 

### Purpose

The purpose is to provide data to a business if it will be sustainable year-round to run and evalutate if we could expand to other islands, and how conditions would vary for the business.

## Results
I received W. Avy's data on Hawaii weather collections as a sqlite file. I was able to quickly and efficiently compare values for the months of June and December. The same can be done to compare every other month throughout a year with different queries.

**The focus here will be solely on June and December**
